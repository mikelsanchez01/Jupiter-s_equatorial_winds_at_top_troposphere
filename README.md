# Jupiter's equatorial winds at top troposphere

This repository contains all the data used in Sanchez-Arregui et al. (2025) to compute (i) the variability of the zonal winds at upper tropospheric levels, and (ii) the characterization of the brightness of the hazes. This data has been derived from Hubbles Space Telescope images at the FQ889N filter covering years from 2015 to 2024.
